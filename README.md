# Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows two players to play turn by turn on a 3x3 grid. It highlights the winning combination, displays game status (win/draw), and includes a restart option. Designed to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
